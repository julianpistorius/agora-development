agora-development
=================

This repo is a bit of a mess.  This is to hold my attempts at learning py2neo, neo4j, flask, and falcon while we develop the Agora Society.

It is all a work in progress.  The tests may run or they may not.

If you are looking for samples of how to use py2neo (2.0), there are some simple ones here.

TO DO:  APIs with falcon and front end with flask
